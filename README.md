## Overview
A private collection of T1, contrast-enhanced T1, and T2 magnetic resonance images separated by brain tumor type.
Images without any type of marking or patient identification, interpreted by radiologists and provided for study purposes.
The images are separated by astrocytoma, carcinoma, ependymoma, ganglioglioma, germinoma, glioblastoma, granuloma, medulloblastoma, meningioma, neurocytoma, oligodendroglioma, papilloma, schwannoma and tuberculoma

This project implements a Brain Tumor Classification Model using EfficientNet-B3 in PyTorch. The model classifies MRI images into 44 different brain tumor types.
